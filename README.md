iOS-CAAnimation-group-demo
==========================

This is a demo project that illustrates various Core Animation techniques, focusing on animation sequences created using CAAnimationGroup

It shows 3 different kinds of animations:

A "clock wipe" animation that gradually reveals an image in a circular arc like a radar display, then hides it again

A simple UIView animation that animates an image in a straight line while increasing the scale of the image and rotating it around it's axis

A complex sequence of animations that are managed using a CAAnimationGroup.
